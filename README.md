# phpCRUD_operation ðŸ’»âœ…

This project provides a basic implementation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations for a PHP application.The project will include a database connection file, a series of functions to perform the operations, and a user interface for interacting with the data.

The database connection file will handle the connection and authentication to the database. The functions will provide the code for the CRUD operations and will allow for parameters to be passed in for data manipulation. The user interface will provide a way for users to interact with the data and perform the operations. The interface will include a form for entering and editing data as well as a list of existing entries.

The project will be designed with security in mind and will include validation checks on all user input. All data will be stored securely in the database and all operations will be performed using prepared statements. The project will also include error logging and handling to ensure that any errors are logged and handled appropriately.
